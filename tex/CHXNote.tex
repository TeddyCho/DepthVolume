\section{Derivatively Priced Trades}
\subsection{Motivation}
Conclusion
Volumes driven by condition code 4
decision to drop condition code 4

\subsection{Definition}
sdaf\footnote{http://www.chx.com/\_posts/information-memos/2015/MR-15-04.pdf}

\subsection{Particular to CHX}
We investigate the CHX points which occur in the top right region (low depth, high volume).Cond Code 4 is ONLY on exchange CHX and FINRA
excluding all cond code 4
D has quotes! after a 1.5 months into 2014


\subsection{Makeup of CHX Volume}

\subsection{Patterns Checked}
For one such outlier, BAC on CHX on 10-Jan-2014, we open the individual trades:
[[TRADE DATA OF ALL CHX TRADES IN BAC ON JAN 10]]

Condition code Y signifies `yellow flag' trading, which `is used to convey periods of time when a Market Center may be experiencing technical difficulties'\footnote{https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/content/technicalsupport/specifications/utp/siptradeinbound.pdf}.

\caption{In January, although trades with condition code 4 constituted less than 15\% of the trades, over 95\% of volume held this condition code.}
\end{figure}

Most interestingly, we observe two large trades with condition code 4, indicating "Derivatively Priced" trades. Online literature suggests that activity in Exchange Traded Products\footnote{http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exchange-traded-products-etp.asp} largely make up these trades, perhaps when different symbols are negotiated at a package price and the individual trades semi-arbitrarily take on parts of the cost.

The fact that such trades are not considered to be a true "Last Sale''\footnote{http://www.nasdaqtrader.com/content/technicalsupport/specifications/utp/utdfspecification.pdf} and are allowed outside of limit-up and limit-down prices\footnote{http://www.finra.org/industry/trf/trade-report-modifiers-and-applicability-limit-uplimit-down-luld-price-bands} strongly indicates that these trades' prices are not dictated by the BBO.

As a response, all trades with condition code 4 were filtered out.

\section{ISO Orders}
This flat relationship could be attributable to the CHX outlier which hovered in the low-depth/high-volume region. Filtering out Derivatively Priced trades remedied this flatness.\\
